English        French        Explanation
the              le
cat             chat         Masculine noun with articleis 
sleeping        dort         present tense of 'dormir' (to sleep)
on              sur          Preposition
couch       le canapé    Masculine noun with article


Sentence Structure:
In French, we follow: Subject + Verb + Preposition + Object

Note: Unlike English, we don't use the present continuous (-ing form)
French uses the simple present tense instead

Hints:

Start with your subject (the cat)
In French, we don't say "is sleeping" but just use "sleeps"
The preposition "sur" (on) comes before the object
Both "chat" and "canapé" are masculine nouns, so they use "le"

Grammar Note:

French doesn't have a continuous tense (-ing)
"is sleeping" becomes just "sleeps" (dort)
Both nouns in this sentence are masculine

  Let's break this simple sentence down!

Vocabulary Table:

English   French       Explanation
I          je          Personal pronoun 
eat       manger       Verb 'to eat' (needs conjugation)
pizza    pizza         Feminine noun


Sentence Structure:
In French, we follow: Subject + Verb + Object

"Je" is always followed by a conjugated verb
"Manger" needs to be conjugated in present tense for "je"

Hints:

Start with "je"
For "manger" in present tense with "je":

Most verbs that end in -er follow the same pattern
Remove -er and add the correct ending for "je"
Think about other -er verbs you might know (parler, danser)


"Pizza" stays the same in French!
