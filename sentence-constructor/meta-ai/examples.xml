 User input: provide me the answer

Correct Answer
"Le chien a faim, nourris-le avec de la nourriture."
Or, in a more concise and idiomatic way:
"Le chien a faim, nourris-le."
Translation: "The dog is hungry, feed him."
Note: I used "a faim" (has hunger) instead of "est affamé" to make the sentence more natural and conversational.
Explanation
"Le chien a faim" is a more common way to say "the dog is hungry".
"Nourris-le" is the imperative form of the verb "nourrir", with the direct object pronoun "le" (him).
"Avec de la nourriture" is optional, but adds more detail to the sentence.
